# Challenge 01: Continuous Integration and Deployment for Contoso Traders using GitHub Actions

<p align="right">Last Updated March 25, 2025</p>

## Introduction
This challenge is designed to evaluate the attendee/user skills in creating a robust CI/CD pipeline leveraging GitHub Actions. It aims to assess your capability to not only establish a seamless pipeline but also to guarantee the successful deployment of the application. Through this challenge, the attendee/user will set up a GitHub repository, implement a CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions, deploy a .NET application to Azure, and make rolling updates to the application.

Here's the solution guide, which includes detailed step-by-step instructions required to complete the challenge.

   ![](../media/ex1-task1-4.png)
   
1. From the GitHub username, note down the **Unique-ID** present in the Username. You'll need this in the upcoming steps.

   ![](../media/cl1-t1-s13.png) 
   
1. Navigate  to the **Visual Studio Code (1)** application . Click on **... (2)** at the top and select **Terminal (3)** from the **drop-down** and choose **New Terminal (4)**, this opens a fresh PowerShell terminal tab.

   ![Quick setup screen is displayed with the copy button next to the GitHub URL textbox selected.](../media/ex1-task1-5.png "Quick setup screen")

1. In Visual Studio Code, run the below commands in the terminal to set your **email** and **username**, which Git uses for commits. Make sure to replace the GitHub account email and username.
   
     ```pwsh
     cd C:\Workspaces\lab\DevOps-DevSecOps-Hackathon-lab-files
     git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

    Run the below-mentioned command in the terminal. Make sure to replace `your_github_repository-url` with the value you copied in step 7 and `Unique-ID` in step 8.

    Note: This step is done to initialize the folder as a Git repository, commit, and submit contents to the remote GitHub branch “main” in the lab files repository created in Step 1. 

      ```pwsh
      git init
      git add .
      git commit -m "Initial commit"
      git branch -M main
      git remote add origin-<Unique-ID> <your_github_repository-url>
      git push -u origin-<Unique-ID> main
      ```
